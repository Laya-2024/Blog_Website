  <h1>Memories That Matter</h1>

  <p class="article-intro">
    Life is made of moments — some loud, some quiet — but the ones that stay
    forever are the memories that truly matter ❤️
  </p>

  <p>
    This article is about the experiences that shaped who I am today.
    Family trips filled with laughter, late-night conversations with friends,
    and personal moments of reflection — all of these hold a special place in my heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe memories are not just photographs. They live in emotions,
    feelings, and stories we carry with us. Through this blog, I want to
    preserve these moments and relive them whenever I look back.
  </p>

  <p>
    If my stories remind you of your own cherished memories, then this blog
    has done what it was meant to do ✨
